# Clinical Neuroradiology - 1st Edition

Welcome to the official repository for **"Clinical Neuroradiology"**, an open-source book entirely written in LaTeX to support the study and learning of neuroradiology. This project aims to provide a comprehensive and free resource, accessible to residents and specialized medical professionals.

This book is designed as an essential guide to neuroradiology for residents and new specialists. It aims to cut through the complexity of neuroimaging, offering an accessible, practical resource for daily practice and board preparation.

## üìö Repository Contents

* **LaTeX Source Code:** Each chapter of the book is written in LaTeX format to ensure high typographical quality.
* **PDF Releases:** Final versions of chapters and the complete book are available in the [Releases](https://github.com/gmadevs/Clinical-neuroradiology/releases) section.

## üåü Key Features & Learning Aids

Drawing heavily from the rich, peer-reviewed knowledge base of Radiopaedia.org, and supplemented by carefully selected open-access articles, this book ensures access to high-quality, up-to-date information.

Throughout the book, you'll find specialized, color-coded text boxes designed to enhance your learning and provide quick reference:

* **Green boxes:** Dedicated to differential diagnoses, helping you consider various possibilities for a given imaging finding.
* **Purple boxes:** Provide crucial practical points, offering tips and insights for real-world application in your daily work.
* **Blue boxes:** Highlight essential radiological signs, drawing your attention to key imaging features critical for accurate interpretation.

## üìñ Book Structure
The book is meticulously structured to guide you through the breadth of neuroradiology, starting with foundational knowledge and progressing to complex pathologies.

Introductory Section: Covers essential neuroanatomy, fundamental neurological concepts, and indispensable radiological techniques.
Section 2: Trauma: Delves into the critical imaging aspects of head and spinal injuries.
Section 3: Vascular: Explores the wide spectrum of cerebrovascular diseases, from acute stroke to vascular malformations.
Section 4: Infection, Inflammation, and Demyelinating Diseases: Provides a detailed approach to infectious and inflammatory conditions, including pyogenic, viral, fungal, and parasitic infections, as well as demyelinating and other inflammatory processes.
Section 5: Neoplasms, Cysts, and Tumor-Like Lesions: Offers a systematic review of central nervous system tumors, encompassing everything from diffuse gliomas and neuronal tumors to meningiomas, metastases, and various non-neoplastic cysts.
Section 6: Toxic, Metabolic, Degenerative, and CSF Disorders: Addresses a range of conditions, including toxic encephalopathies, inherited and acquired metabolic disorders, dementias, and hydrocephalus.
Section 7: Congenital Malformations and Genetic Tumor Syndromes: Concludes the book with an in-depth look at developmental anomalies of the brain and spine, along with associated genetic and neurocutaneous syndromes.
This logical progression is designed to provide a cohesive and thorough learning experience across all major neuroradiological domains.
