\section{Gluten-related disorders}

\textbf{Gluten-related disorders} are a collection of conditions that are the result of a reaction to the consumption of gluten a protein found in wheat, barley and rye .

Gluten-related disorders can be broadly divided into :

\begin{enumerate}
	\tightlist
	\item
	celiac disease: most common and most widely recognized
	\item
	wheat allergy
	\item
	non-celiac gluten sensitivity
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Celiac disease}

Celiac disease is a T-cell mediate autoimmune response to gluten-derived polypeptides resulting in a small bowel enteropathy (see celiac disease article).

Many non-gastrointestinal manifestations are, however, also recognized including cerebellar ataxia and polyneuropathy .

\paragraph{Wheat allergy}

Wheat allergies are due to IgE antibodies and manifestations will depend on the route of exposure: oral ingestion results in wheat food allergy, inhalation may result in baker's asthma or baker's rhinitis or even a hypersensitivity pneumonitis.

\paragraph{Non-celiac gluten sensitivity}

This is a poorly defined term but generally refers to the manifestations of a variety of symptoms following gluten exposure that are not, however, immune or allergy-mediated .
